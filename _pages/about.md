Weather forecasting is one of the spheres that affect crops to grow, or even determine if we should travel or not, and that have to do with disaster preparedness. The traditional basis of forecasting, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), has been around for decades successfully fulfilling the function of capturing atmospheric dynamics in simulation models, which are highly dependent on physics. Thereby, the technologies like these on the machine learning domain together provided a better improvement in the field of weather forecasting. METNET, the type of neural network that used smart algorithms to help the forecaster’s make a prediction of rainfall intensity with an outstanding accuracy. This blog post aims to lead you into the structure of METNET which will be done by uncovering the architecture, functions, and the future potential of the model.

Diving into MetNet: Forecasting by leveraging the power of DL in weather prediction
======

Overview
------

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
MetNet is a deep learning model that is specially designed for the short-term forecasting of the precipitation, which is between 1 to 8 hours ahead. MetNet is distinct from the customary Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models as it utilizes varied sources such as satellite images, radar observations and weather prediction models to identify the complex weather patterns. Its structure consists of the spatiotemporal convolutional layers and attention mechanisms that work with the data at different scales hence, it generates the high-resolution, probable forecasts. The meteorological data and the latest training methods, on the one hand, MetNet enhances the long-term weather forecasts, on the other, it becomes an important tool for use in agriculture, disaster management, urban planning and transportation.
